WiFi-Controlled Car Using ESP8266 NodeMCU and Blynk
Project Description:

This project demonstrates how to build a WiFi-controlled car using the ESP8266 NodeMCU and Blynk application. The car is remotely operated via a smartphone, making it an excellent IoT-based robotics project.

The vehicle is powered by two DC motors driven by an L298N motor driver and steered using a servo motor. The control interface is designed using the Blynk app, where buttons and sliders allow the user to move the car forward, backward, left, or right. Additionally, the project includes LED indicators for signaling and a headlight for night operation.

This project is ideal for beginners and hobbyists interested in IoT, robotics, and remote-controlled vehicles. It provides hands-on experience with ESP8266 programming, motor control, and IoT-based automation.
Key Features:

✅ WiFi-based remote control using the Blynk app
✅ Dual DC motor drive with speed control
✅ Servo motor steering mechanism
✅ LED indicators and headlight for improved visibility
✅ Simple and cost-effective IoT project

This project serves as a great learning experience in Arduino programming, IoT-based automation, and wireless robotics.
